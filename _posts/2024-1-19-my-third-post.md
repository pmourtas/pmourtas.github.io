## Reflection
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong> Content </strong><br></p>

In Unit 1, we had an introduction to machine learning (ML), its algorithms, and how it works. We learned about its capabilities, the challenges it presents, and the opportunities it offers now and in the future. We gained a better understanding of its role and utility in the industry, as well as the skills needed to become proficient in its application. Additionally, we explored how ML has developed over the years and the categories into which it has been divided: Unsupervised, Supervised, and Reinforcement Learning (IBM, 2024). Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for prediction tasks; Unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data without specific instructions; while Reinforcement learning involves learning from interactions with an environment, where an agent receives feedback in order to improve its performance.

Moreover, we began reading our core book, “An Introduction to Machine Learning” (M. Kubat, 2021), and engaged in our first collaborative discussion topic, which involved identifying and documenting the significant impacts that an information system failure has had on a company, its customers, and the overall cost of that failure. To enhance our discussion, we conducted online research. Through this process, we encountered various mistakes made by large and well-known organizations in the past, which resulted in catastrophic consequences for their businesses. This underscored the importance of monitoring and frequently auditing our systems before launching them publicly, as well as ensuring that a system is constructed to function even in worst-case scenarios, with all necessary safety measures in place.
Lastly, we had our first seminar with our tutor, which was an introductory session aimed at meeting our peers, getting to know each other, and summarizing what we will learn in this specific unit.

In Units 2,3 and 4, we took a step back to revisit exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation, and regression (IBM, 2024). This was important for our learning because, for machine learning to work at its best, we must thoroughly explore the data we are providing and clean it appropriately to retain only the information that truly matters. We must not forget that iteration is the mother of learning. By applying EDA to our data, we can validate it and check for errors using various tools, such as visualizations, to gain insights as well. On the other hand, the statistical techniques of correlation and regression help us quantify and describe the relationships between variables in our data.

Regarding correlation, we reviewed concepts such as covariance and the Pearson correlation coefficient, as well as independent and dependent variables, and the negative and positive relationships between variables (Geeks for Geeks, 2024). Meanwhile, in our regression review, we examined linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression (B. Beers, 2024). We learned about their limitations and how they are visually represented, thanks to relevant videos and lecture casts.

Additionally, we continued our collaborative discussion, culminating in a summarization post in Unit 3 after interacting with two of our peers by providing a response to each in Unit 2.

Lastly, we completed two exercises for our second and third seminars in Units 2 and 4, as well as an e-portfolio activity in Unit 3. The latter involved reviewing some Python files that demonstrated different types of regression, along with covariance and Pearson correlation. For the first exercise, we applied exploratory data analysis (EDA) to a dataset, identifying any missing values, estimating skewness and kurtosis, creating a correlation heat map, generating scatter plots for different parameters, and replacing categorical values with numerical values (University of Southampton, 2024; R. Awati, 2023). In the second exercise, we were provided with two datasets that we needed to join together in order to address the missing values, investigate any correlation between them through a plot, and evaluate the Pearson correlation coefficient. Additionally, we performed linear regression for values within a specific date interval as a filter. These activities helped us familiarize ourselves with coding while also applying our theoretical knowledge in practice.

In Units 5 and 6, we explored clustering, which is the task of grouping sets of similar objects and is part of exploratory data analysis. We familiarized ourselves with the basic concepts behind cluster analysis and examined the different methods that exist, including K-means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN (Geeks for Geeks, 2024). Additionally, we learned about methods to evaluate our clustering results and determine the optimal number of clusters to implement in our models, such as the elbow method and silhouette coefficient (Ad. B. Habib, 2021). We also completed an exercise calculating the Jaccard coefficient to understand how it works, along with a few animations illustrating clustering.

Meanwhile, in Unit 6, we participated in our fourth seminar exercise, which focused on K-means clustering. In this exercise, we had to choose one of the three available datasets to gain hands-on experience with this specific method. We opted to proceed with Task A: the Iris dataset (Kaggle, 2024).

Lastly, also in Unit 6, we developed a team project report analyzing the Airbnb business using a given dataset from New York City (Kaggle, 2024). For this project, we applied the knowledge we had gained in previous units. However, the dataset presented challenges, as the headers of each column lacked descriptive information. There were also many inconsistencies and anomalies in the data. Despite these issues, we figured out how to address them after spending many hours exploring the dataset. Thanks to our tutor, our team had already been formed in Unit 2, giving us ample time to analyze our data and communicate our findings. The team project was an insightful experience, as we encountered various perspectives and approaches to tackling project challenges. In the end, we managed to complete it successfully and received a distinction.

In Units 7 and 8, we were introduced to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), a biology-inspired algorithm that can learn from the environment and adapt like animals do (IBM, 2024). We learned about how ANNs are constructed and what they consist of, including different types of layers and activation functions. Also, for what they are being used for and why. There were sufficient materials available, including Python code, which made the content clearer and more understandable. Additionally, we learned about the procedure that ANNs follow in order to be trained and learn efficiently through backpropagation, which reduces errors and updates weights.

The challenge we faced was that the coding material was not explained in detail, even with comments. However, this may have been intentional, encouraging us to engage in the process of researching each line and understanding how they function and why we are using them.

Furthermore, in Unit 8, we had our fifth seminar exercise, where we had to read two articles and expand upon them with our views and concerns. The first article discussed the business areas where neural networks can be applied, while the second focused on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in personal insurance (M. Mayo, 2017; GOV UK, 2019).

Figure 11: Unit 8 Seminar Exercise.


Lastly, we had our second collaborative discussion, which this time centered on AI writers (M. Hutson, 2021). We were tasked with exploring and documenting the risks and benefits of the futuristic automated work being done by AI that could potentially replace some current job positions.

Figure 12: Unit 8 Initial Post in Collaborative Discussion 2.


In Units 9 and 10, we were introduced to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), an extension of artificial neural networks that form the basis of computer vision (IMB, 2024). Computer vision gives machines the ability to see and explore the world around us. We learned about their characteristics, construction, functionality, and applications.

Additionally, we participated in numerous tutorials and video lessons focusing on the use of CNNs for image recognition and the workings of different layers. We were provided with significant portions of Python code that we could manipulate and interact with to observe the prediction functionality of the CNN algorithm. This hands-on experience was quite interesting and helped us become more familiar with the theoretical concepts.

Aside from that, in Unit 9, we had an activity related to an incident involving the use of AI—specifically, an automated facial recognition system for identifying criminals and terrorists (M. Wall, 2019). Although the system was not sufficiently developed, the police and security forces were testing it nonetheless. Our task was to write down our thoughts on the ethical and social implications of this CNN technology.

Figure 13: Unit 9 Seminar Exercise.


Lastly, we continued with our final collaborative discussion, culminating in a summary post in Unit 10. This followed our interactions with two of our peers by providing responses to each in Unit 9, just as we did in Unit 3.

In Unit 11, we learned about model selection and evaluation as they pertain to machine learning. This was the core focus of the module. We learned how to distinguish whether the model's task is prediction or classification and how effectively a model can predict a dataset based on its accuracy level. We reviewed different methods and techniques for evaluation and discussed ways to improve overall performance. Moreover, we became familiar with the challenges we face, such as bias, underfitting, and overfitting. We explored available strategies for optimization and classification metrics, including types of errors, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) (Medium, 2024).

Lastly, we had another significant assignment. However, unlike the team project in Unit 6, it was an individual presentation. This time, we were required to design a neural network to assess the efficacy of a model for object recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset (Al. Krizhevsky, 2009). To do this, we needed to partition a validation set from the provided training dataset and address specific aspects, such as the methods we used to construct our neural network and the detailed reasons behind our choices.

Figure 17: Unit 11 Assessment Link.


Finally, in the last and conclusive Unit 12, we read about the future of industries in combination with machine learning (A. Deiz-Olivan et al., 2019). We gained insight into new possible trends and perspectives, as well as the challenges we currently face due to this development, such as fake videos and images created by AI, and the disinformation that is rampant in our media (CDEI, 2019).
Additionally, we had our final seminar exercise. This time, we had to choose a topic relevant to the use of machine learning in the industry as a prognostic tool.

Figure 18: Unit 12 Seminar Exercise.


Last but not least, we were required to develop a reflective summary report for the entire module.



<p><strong>Challenges and Drawbacks</strong><br></p>

This module, which began easily, started to become increasingly difficult. In the first units, we encountered topics that we had already seen in previous modules. However, when we faced the core learnings, things became more challenging. The lecture casts were somewhat helpful, but not entirely sufficient. The core book was not very useful either, as it focused mainly on theoretical concepts that were not directly relevant to our assignments. Additionally, the coding materials provided were not particularly helpful, as there was no explanation of the code or its individual lines. We had to figure everything out on our own. Fortunately, thanks to the internet and our own research, we managed to understand some concepts quite well, but we still did not grasp the entire picture. It is possible that the subject itself is too vast to fully comprehend from a single source. Nevertheless, with many hours of practice on practical assignments, we learned how to solve problems appropriately by researching each step and question posed.

Furthermore, I would like to highlight another challenge, the team project. While it was beneficial for our interaction with peers, scheduling meetings proved difficult due to our work commitments and the time differences between our countries. This situation needs to be addressed for improvement.
Lastly, as I mentioned in the past, the reflection report is not particularly helpful for our learning. It would be more beneficial to have a practical exercise or a real assignment that simulates a work environment. This approach would be advantageous for both us and businesses, as companies prefer candidates who are already experienced in solving real-world, day-to-day problems (S. Nair, 2017).



<p><strong>Opportunities and Positives</strong><br></p>

The opportunity to work on two specific assignments in Unit 6, the team project, and in Unit 11, the development of a neural network model to assess the CIFAR-10 dataset, was extraordinary and invaluable. Through these experiences, I researched many significant concepts that I had never encountered before in my life. As a result, I learned numerous foundational principles that I believe are essential for machine learning.
Overall, the research I conducted, along with the structured questions posed by our tutor, helped enhance my problem-solving skills. The team project and collaborative discussions improved my teamwork abilities and fostered personal growth.

Regarding the subject matter covered in this module, I am confident that it will provide a competitive advantage in my career. Moreover, by applying the knowledge I have gained, along with a bit more experience and research for personal development in this field, I will be equipped with the skills needed to make informed business decisions, foster creativity and innovation, conduct meaningful analyses, and generate insightful information. I will also be able to effectively assess and manage risks, automate tasks, and maintain quality control in everything I do. Studying machine learning is a powerful asset in today’s world (D. Flower, 2023).
