## Reflection

<p><strong> Content </strong><br></p>
<p>In units 1 and 2, we learn about the types and the need for data visualizations, which are in high demand, through our university’s lecturecasts. As a visual species, humans always interact with their environment to gain insights and make decisions (Gimblett R. et al., 2001). Nowadays, we succeeded in further developing that artifact in every aspect. We are now equipped with significant tools that can effectively visualize even the most complex data. With the programming languages and no-code applications, we made the visualizations revolutionary (Hashemi-Pour C. et al., 2024).</p>

In addition, we had a case study where we explored some financial complex data (Bostock M., 2013) and a collaborative discussion with our peers in which we had to compare two websites in terms of their visuals (Easy Jet, 2020) (Ryanair, 2020). The scope of the latest was for us to use all the appropriate knowledge of our readings so as to make a legit comparison analysis among them describing their pros and cons. In the end, our tutor gave us his feedback regarding our point of view, making us better as researchers (Columbia CTL, 2024).

The most interesting thing from those two units was the scientifically proven way of how our brain and eyes are engaged to comprehend the visualizations (Essex University, 2024).

In units 3, 4, and 5, we came along again with R, which is considered one of the mainstream programming languages for data analysis and statistics (Console Fl., 2023). We started with our first core book, “R for Data Science” (Grolemund G, & Wickham H., 2017). This time we emphasized more the ggplot2 library of R for data visualizations and the dplyr library of R for data transformation. Of course, we read once again about the basics, how to import data with readr library of R, and how to make an appropriate exploratory data analysis. That significant repetition was necessary because it is well known that repetition is the mother of learning (Ziglar Z., 2024).

Thanks to our core book, we had the opportunity to view a lot of types of visualizations that were applied to R built-in sample datasets (STHDA, 2024). We also learn how to manipulate both of them appropriately and for what reason. Needless to say, when we are talking about exploratory data analysis, there are a lot of investigated reasons for manipulations because we need to understand our data well (Code Academy, 2024). There were a lot of tricks and ideas available for the taking. 

However, there were times that a piece of code had become obsolete, but that is common with programming languages (Vastola J., 2023). So, we had to do our own research to make that work similar or even better. Other than that, at the end of each chapter, there were a lot of exercises similar to the chapter content, giving us the chance to hone our skills and apply our learnings.

Lastly, on these two units, we had to continue with our collaborative discussion from the previous units. We had to make a contribution to our peers and a summarization post regarding what else we had learned from our peers posts and the new units.

In units 6 and 7, we started with our second and last core book for that module, “An introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R” (James G. et al., 2021). In that book, we familiarized ourselves with the machine learning methods of statistics (Coursera, 2024). More specifically, we learn about the linear regression, classification, and tree-based model methods. We also make an introduction to the neural networks of deep learning. Through our reading and many solved examples, we got an idea of how to train the machine and make that predict for us relevant answers from within the data. Of course, that prediction was coming along with some performance measurement methods that were necessary to be performed in order to choose the most efficient machine prediction model. Other than that, we proceed with the necessity of the dimensionality reduction companion with the clustering techniques for easier visualizations and interpretations of our data.

Those two units were the most difficult of the module because the learning context was very complex and multi-layered, as it concerned the numerous models and methods that exist and have to be applied in order to choose the one that outperforms all the others. Needless to say, for every dataset, our models can have different performances (Pure Storage, 2024). So, in cases like that, we also have to learn how to automate this whole task so as to turn it into being more time efficient.

In unit 8, we had a lecturecast, which was very informative as it concerned the types of charts and the circumstances that they better match (Hess K., 2022). Other than that, we came along for a little bit with Python just to read about its superiority as a programming language because its functionality is wider than R (Kareliya A., 2023). Also, we review some visualization examples that the Plotly library of Python provides (Plotly, 2024).

Lastly, on that unit we had our first programming exercise, which was divided into two parts. In the first part, we had to make an exploratory analysis of our given and cleansed data. In that case, we had to investigate our data with a lot of visualizations and statistical measures with the use of R. In the second and most difficult part, we had to develop the statistical modeling in conjunction with their performance measurements that we mention in the last two units above.

No matter how difficult our assignment seemed at first, our tutor gave us clear and appropriate instructions on how to approach it correctly and documented it. So, thanks to our tutor's informative seminar lectures that we had in almost every section of that module, we got the point of the whole procedure of machine learning very well. Thus, we were able to move forward and proceed with confidence.

Finaly, we got our tutor feedback, who was highlighting our positives and negatives. In that way, students can now know their imperfections and how to deduce them appropriately. However, it is now well known that our university hardly gives an excellent grade, even if you do not have anything negative in your work.

In the rest and last units 9, 10, 11, and 12, we got into the dashboard design principles approach in conjunction with the visualization software of Tableau. We learn essential things about the structure, color, and type of the dashboards, as well as how to implement some of the best practices in the market with Tableau. Of course, a comprehensive and overall tutorial learning of tableau preceded (Tableau, 2024 a). 

In unit 12, we also had a formative activity and our two final assignments, designing a Tableau dashboard and composing a reflection report for the whole module. Prior to that, in unit 9, we had an optional assignment of developing a dashboard draft for a fictional purpose (Tableau, 2024 b). In that way, we could present a part of our final dashboard idea to our tutor so as to get a guided feedback on whether we are on the right track or not. Indeed, that was very thoughtful and useful.

As it concerns the formative activity, we had to review some articles related to the virtual and augmented reality technologies as a futuristic approach to visualizations within the businesses (Nichols G., 2019) (Kurbatov V., 2017) (Dalton J., 2016). Our job was to critically evaluate their possible functionalities and capabilities that they might have.

Our tutor, though his seminar lectures, once again succeeded in informing us appropriately, giving us the necessary guidelines. From the very beginning, he had informed us to begin developing our reflection report step by step along with our current units, writing down what we had learned, so to meet the deadline. In general, he was very informative and helpful, like our whole module, which was very detailed with everything.

In conclusion, I would like to propose that we should replace the reflection assignment with a technical exercise that simulates real tasks commonly faced in large companies. This shift would significantly enhance our technical knowledge and equip us with valuable skills that will be directly applicable in the job market upon completing our master's degree (Scarlet Ch., 2023).
