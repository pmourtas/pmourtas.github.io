## Summary of Units and Assignments
<p></p>
<p></p>
The Research Methods and Professional Practice module has served as a vital component of our academic journey, providing us with theoretical foundations and practical tools in preparation for our final thesis. Although theoretical in nature, the module was highly interactive and assignment-heavy, requiring us to engage critically with the material and collaborate with our peers. The content was delivered across twelve structured units, each focusing on essential aspects of research methodology, ethics, data analysis, professional development, and project management. Below is a comprehensive summary of each unit and the key assignments associated with them.


<strong> Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing. </strong>

In the first unit, we were introduced to the fundamental principles of research. This included the scientific method, the purpose of academic research, and an overview of research ethics. We explored two major types of logical reasoning: deductive reasoning, which moves from general principles to specific conclusions, and inductive reasoning, which derives general insights from specific observations (Miessler, 2020). Deduction aims for logical certainty but is only as reliable as its premises, while induction, although less conclusive, is more commonly applied in real-world problem-solving.

This unit also emphasized the ethical principles governing research, especially within the computing field. We examined the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct, which outlines the responsibilities of computing professionals in terms of legal compliance, respect for privacy, and the responsible use of data (Deckard, 2023; BCS, 2021). These ethical considerations were particularly important given the increasing relevance of technologies such as Generative AI, which formed the focus of our first Reflective Activity: Ethics in Computing in the Age of Generative AI (Dawson, 2015).

Lastly, in preparation for future units, we were asked to select a topic from a given list as the basis for our upcoming Literature Review and Research Proposal Presentation.


<strong> Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal. </strong>

Unit 2 focused on the initial stages of academic research: the formulation of research questions, the development of a research proposal, and the construction of a literature review. We learned to approach these tasks using both analytical and creative thinking. This included identifying gaps in the literature, refining research questions for clarity and focus, and aligning research goals with appropriate methodologies (Boza, 2022; Purdue Online Writing Lab, 2025).

In this unit, we continued to contribute to the Collaborative Learning Discussion by engaging with our peers and providing thoughtful responses to their initial posts.

<strong> Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods. </strong>

In Unit 3, we explored the philosophical assumptions underpinning research. These included ontology (the nature of reality), epistemology (the nature of knowledge), and axiology (the role of values in research). These philosophical underpinnings shape our research decisions and influence our selection of methods and data collection strategies.

We then examined different types of research design, specifically exploratory research—used to investigate undefined or complex issues—and conclusive research, used to test hypotheses and derive structured conclusions. The three main research approaches—qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods—were presented in detail. Each approach was connected to its relevant philosophical stance, purpose, and types of data collection tools (BRM, 2018; UoL, 2025; Sage, 2021; QuestionPro, 2021).

We learned about primary and secondary data and the tools used to gather each type, including surveys, interviews, case studies, and experiments (Crewsell, 2022; Saunders et al., 2023).

Additionally, the Collaborative Learning Discussion concluded with a summary post, where we reflected on the insights gained from peer interaction.

<strong> Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations. </strong>

Unit 4 explored in detail the tools used for qualitative research, including case studies, focus groups, and observational methods. We learned that while case studies are effective for exploring complex phenomena, they may lack generalizability and are vulnerable to researcher bias. Focus groups, on the other hand, offer rich insights into participants’ perceptions, especially when the group shares common characteristics.

Observation was divided into quantitative (structured, numerical) and qualitative (unstructured, behavior-based) methods. These observations may take place in controlled environments or natural settings, and the role of the researcher (passive vs. active) significantly impacts the outcome (Priya, 2021; Farquhar, 2012; Abramson & Sánchez-Jankowski, 2020).

As part of our learning, we completed an Ethics Case Study Activity where we analyzed a real-world scenario and identified the ethical considerations involved, particularly in relation to privacy.

<strong> Unit 5: Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design. </strong>

This unit focused on interviews and survey research, two of the most widely used methods in social science and computing research. We examined the differences between interviews (typically qualitative) and surveys (typically quantitative), and we explored questionnaire design, including how to avoid common pitfalls in the wording, structure, and sequence of questions (Brace, 2013; DCS, 2012).

We were taught how to distinguish between the survey as a data collection process and the questionnaire as a specific instrument. The unit also covered open- and closed-ended questions and their appropriate uses depending on the research methodology. We discussed the importance of pre-testing and post-testing, especially for assessing the impact of new systems or interventions (Learning for Actions, 2025; Campos, 2015).

The unit concluded with Reflective Activity 2, where we assessed a case study involving the misuse of surveys, discussing the scenario from legal, social, and professional perspectives (Al Jazeera, 2018).

<strong> Unit 6: Quantitative Methods - Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. </strong>

Unit 6 introduced us to quantitative data analysis, beginning with descriptive statistics. We learned how to summarize data using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation). We also explored graphical representations of data and how these aid in communication and decision-making (Berenson et al., 2019).

This unit emphasized the need for careful preparation of data and the selection of appropriate methods based on the level of measurement of each variable. We also began working with sample datasets in preparation for future statistical analysis.


<strong> Unit 7: Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing. </strong>

In Unit 7, we explored inferential statistics, focusing on how to make generalizations from sample data to broader populations. We practiced techniques such as confidence intervals, significance testing, and hypothesis testing to determine whether differences in data were statistically meaningful (Berenson et al., 2019; Purdue University, 2023).

We used sample data to conduct hypothesis testing in practice, giving us hands-on experience with statistical methods. 

We also began our second Collaborative Learning Discussion, where we analyzed a new case study with a focus on ethical accuracy in data reporting. 
![pic15](https://github.com/pmourtas/pmourtas.github.io/blob/main/assets/images/banners/00015.png?raw=true)

<strong> Unit 8: Data Analysis and Visualization. </strong>

This unit shifted focus to the analysis and presentation of both quantitative and qualitative data. We compared the structure and interpretation of these data types, learning that while quantitative analysis follows a clear sequence, qualitative analysis involves coding and thematic analysis, which are more subjective and iterative (BRM, 2021; Bhatia, 2018).

We explored the use of dashboards, charts, and graphs to convey insights, and discussed how data visualization helps stakeholders make informed decisions. We continued working with the same datasets from earlier units, creating visual representations of key metrics (Microsoft, 2023; Elsevier Research, 2025; FT, 2023). 

The Collaborative Learning Discussion continued with further peer engagement.

<strong> Unit 9: Validity and Generalizability in Research. </strong>

Unit 9 focused on ensuring the quality and integrity of research findings through reliability, validity, and generalizability. We learned that reliability refers to the consistency of measurements, while validity ensures that what we are measuring is what we actually intend to measure. Generalizability is key to applying findings to wider populations (Saunders et al., 2023; Schneider, 2018).

We also reflected on the challenges of analyzing qualitative data, and how to address them through careful planning, coding strategies, and transparent reporting. 

This unit concluded the second Collaborative Learning Discussion with a final summary post.

Figure: Summary Post


<strong> Unit 10: Research Writing. </strong>

In Unit 10, we focused on the critical skill of research writing. We were guided through the structure of academic documents such as research papers, dissertations, and proposals. The unit emphasized clarity, coherence, and alignment between research questions, methods, and conclusions (Dawson, 2015; Heard, 2016).

We also submitted our completed Statistical Analysis Worksheets, applying the skills learned in Units 7 and 8.

<strong> Unit 11: Going Forward: Professional Development and Your e-Portfolio. </strong>

Unit 11 highlighted the importance of professional development through the creation of an e-Portfolio, which compiles evidence of our learning, skills, and growth throughout the course (Jisc, 2012; Janssens et al., 2022). The Professional Skills Matrix, aligned with BCS competencies and Essex graduate attributes, helped us identify our strengths and development needs.

We explored the concept of Continuous Professional Development (CPD), and how reflective practices support lifelong learning. We also explored how the Learning Loop helps visualize our learning journey and future goals.


<strong> Unit 12: Project Management and Managing Risk. </strong>

The final unit focused on project management, specifically for computing-related projects. We were introduced to project management methodologies, performance metrics, and tools for risk assessment (Nicholas & Steyn, 2020; PMI, 2020). The unit stressed that no project is without risk, and taught us how to develop and implement risk management plans.

We also explored how to manage change, whether it arises from stakeholder demands or shifting project environments. Tools supporting remote collaboration and digital project tracking were discussed as essential components of modern project delivery (McManus, 2024; Mckinsey, 2023).





<strong> Reflection on Learning. </strong>

The Research Methods and Professional Practice module has been one of the most formative experiences in our academic journey. While it demanded our full attention through various tasks and assignments, it rewarded us with an invaluable understanding of research, ethics, data analysis, and professional growth. As we now look ahead toward our final thesis and beyond into our careers, we can clearly see how the lessons from this module will continue to guide and support us.

One of the key takeaways from this module has been the solid foundation it provided in research methodology. From the very first unit, we were introduced to different forms of reasoning—deductive and inductive—which taught us how to build logical arguments and formulate valid conclusions based on evidence (Miessler, 2020). This knowledge has helped us understand the importance of structuring our research in a way that is not only logical but also grounded in established theory (Saunders et al., 2012; British Research Methodology, 2018).

Learning about the entire research process—from formulating questions to choosing methods and analyzing results—has empowered us to approach academic work with more confidence. We no longer see research as a vague or abstract concept but as a systematic process with clear stages and purpose (Boza, 2022; Bhatia, 2018; Crewsell, 2013). This perspective is crucial not just for our thesis, but for any future role in industry or academia where critical thinking and structured inquiry are necessary.

Another major theme throughout the module was ethics, and we now understand that ethical research is not just a formality—it is a fundamental responsibility. We learned how to recognize and navigate complex ethical challenges, especially when working with human participants or sensitive data (Abramson & Sánchez-Jankowski, 2020; Schneider, 2018). This emphasis on integrity, respect, and professionalism in our conduct will shape how we approach any future project, whether academic or professional.

We also became more familiar with professional codes of conduct and how these guide our behavior in real-world situations. The case studies we analyzed were powerful tools that showed us how ethical theory plays out in practice, particularly in the field of computing where data, AI, and emerging technologies can raise serious ethical questions (ACM, 2025; BCS, 2021; Deckard, 2023). The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica case, for instance, highlighted the urgent need for ethical awareness in tech applications (Al Jazeera, 2018; McKinsey, 2023).

One of the strengths of this module was the balance between theory and practice. Through assignments like literature reviews, statistical worksheets, and proposal presentations, we developed hands-on skills in research design, critical evaluation of sources, and data analysis (Dawson, 2015; Farquhar, 2012; Priya, 2021). These exercises gave us the opportunity to apply what we were learning in a meaningful way.

We also gained experience working with different types of data—both qualitative and quantitative. Understanding how to collect, interpret, and present data will make us much more capable researchers (QuestionPro, 2021). We now know how to select appropriate methods based on the research question, assess the reliability and validity of our findings, and communicate our conclusions effectively. These are transferable skills that will benefit us no matter where our careers take us.

As it concerns the statistics, through guided exercises and step-by-step activities, we developed a solid understanding of both descriptive and inferential statistics (Berenson et al., 2019; Purdue University, 2023). Learning how to make sense of numerical data, test hypotheses, and visualize results has been a major confidence booster. These skills will be especially valuable as we work on our dissertations, where analyzing our own data accurately and clearly will be crucial to the success of our research (Elsevier Research, 2025; FT, 2023).

The collaborative learning discussions were another meaningful component of this module. Engaging with our peers, reading different perspectives, and reflecting on shared feedback helped us grow not just as researchers, but as communicators and team players. We learned how to engage in constructive academic debate, which strengthened our ability to think critically and defend our ideas (Healey et al., 2020).

These discussions also reinforced the value of collaboration in professional environments. In today’s tech-driven world, teamwork is essential—whether we are developing software, designing systems, or conducting user research. Being able to collaborate thoughtfully and ethically is a key strength we will carry forward (Janssens et al., 2022; Jisc, 2012).

One of the most practical benefits of this module is how well it has prepared us for the next big challenge: our thesis. Every step we took—from choosing a topic and reviewing literature to building our research proposal—was a building block that will make the dissertation process smoother and more manageable. The emphasis on structured writing and clear communication will also help us produce high-quality work that we can be proud of (Heard, 2016).

Beyond the thesis, we know that these research and writing skills will be valuable in the workplace. Whether we are writing reports, analyzing systems, or contributing to academic publications, the ability to communicate clearly, back up our claims with evidence, and follow a structured approach will always be in demand.

This module did not just teach us about research—it also taught us how to reflect on our own growth. Through the e-Portfolio and Professional Skills Matrix, we learned to document our learning journey, identify our strengths and areas for development, and plan for continuous improvement.

We now understand the importance of lifelong learning in a fast-paced industry like computing. Technologies evolve, roles change, and new challenges emerge regularly. Having a mindset of continuous professional development will allow us to stay relevant and adaptable. Whether through industry certifications, advanced study, or independent research, we feel ready to keep learning long after graduation.

The last units on project management and risk analysis gave us a practical perspective on how research and professional projects are actually implemented. We now see how important it is to plan strategically, assess risks, and be ready to manage changes as they arise (PMI, 2020; McManus, 2004; Nicholas & Steyn, 2020).

We also feel more confident using tools for remote collaboration and digital project tracking—skills that are increasingly vital in a hybrid or fully remote work environment (Microsoft, 2024). Managing change, communicating across teams, and adapting plans while maintaining project goals are all part of the skillset we have begun to build.

This module was a bridge between academic study and professional practice. It gave us the tools to think like researchers, act like professionals, and grow as lifelong learners. The knowledge we have gained—from data analysis and research writing to ethics and project management—has given us a well-rounded toolkit to face the challenges of the computing industry with confidence.

More importantly, this module has shaped how we think. It taught us to be curious, careful, and ethical. It reminded us that good research and good practice are built on solid foundations of evidence, structure, and reflection. As we move forward—into our theses, into our careers, and into our future projects—we carry with us not only the skills, but also the mindset that will help us succeed.
